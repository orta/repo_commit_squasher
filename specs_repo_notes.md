### Notes specific to the CocoaPods Specs repo

* We keep an old pre-sharded branch (https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/tree/predates_sharding_branch) and tag (https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/releases/tag/v0.32.1) around for older clients. This needs to continue to exist.

  This means creating a new branch, and new tag that refers to a new orphaned commit of the same file structure.
